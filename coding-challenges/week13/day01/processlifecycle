Question 2. What role does an operating system perform.
An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, 
(2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.


Question 3. What is a process ?
Ans. In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. 
Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.


Question 4. What is the job of a long term scheduler ?
It is also called a job scheduler. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. 
It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling.


Question 5. What is Response time ?
Response time is the total amount of time it takes to respond to a request for service. That service can be anything from a memory fetch, to a disk IO, 
to a complex database query, or loading a full web page. Ignoring transmission time for a moment, the response time is the sum of the service time and wait time.
